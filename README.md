# Turtle Olympics

Turtle Olympics is a quick and fun mini-game that is built with Python Turtle where you are able to place bets on which turtle will come out winning the 100-metre dash race!  

## Instructions
There are 5 turtles, each turtle representing a colour of the rings in the Olympic Flag. The turtles will all start on the starting line and cross the finish line. You will have the opportunity to bet money, with your starting value of $500 on who you think will win. The amount of money you bet on is the amount of money you will receive if you have guessed correctly or lose if you have guessed incorrectly. Although if there has been a tie with another turtle you have betted on, you will unfortunately lose the money you betted and the tie won't count as a correct guess. There is no minimum amount you have to bet, but you can only bet up to the amount you have left. You can play until you want to stop or until you have $0 left.
